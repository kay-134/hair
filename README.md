# 👩🏾‍🦱 Kayley’s Hair Tips

Welcome to my curated collection of go-to hair products! 

*Disclaimer: This is everything I use on my hair (that’s like 3A/4B for people who care about that sort of thing)/my techniques just to share with the masses and not to not gatekeep!* 

*I am no means a hair wizard, **I wish**, but God hasn’t given me that role atm so just keep that in mind :)*. 💖
